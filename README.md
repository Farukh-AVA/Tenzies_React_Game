# Tenzies React Game
Tenzies is a fun and addictive dice game where players try to roll and match dice combinations to score points. I created this game based on a tutorial from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview). However, I added functionality such as:
 * CSS: implemented real dots on the dice.
 * CSS: implemented rotating animation for dice 
 * Implemented a win time 
 * Storing the best time to localStorage
 * Number of rolls count
 * Storing the least number of rolls to localStorage
